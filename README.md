## :dart: About ##

This project is a Customer Churn Prediction application built using Streamlit and PyTorch. It allows users to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on various customer attributes, such as credit score, age, balance, and more.

## :sparkles: Features ##

The following features are used to predict customer churn in this model:

- **CreditScore**: The credit score of the customer. Higher scores indicate a better credit history.
- **Age**: The age of the customer. Age is an important factor in predicting churn as it correlates with life stages and financial stability.
- **Tenure**: The number of years the customer has been with the company. Long tenure can indicate loyalty and reduce the likelihood of churn.
- **Balance**: The current balance of the customerâ€™s account. Customers with low balances may be more likely to churn.
- **NumOfProducts**: The number of products the customer holds with the company. Having more products may reduce churn likelihood.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card with the company (1 for Yes, 0 for No). Having a credit card could reduce churn chances.
- **IsActiveMember**: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (1 for Yes, 0 for No). Active members are less likely to churn.
- **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated annual salary of the customer. This can be an indicator of financial stability and churn likelihood.
- **Geography**: The geographical location of the customer. This feature includes the following values:
  - **France**
  - **Germany**
  - **Spain**
  
  These are encoded into numerical features using One-Hot Encoding.
  
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (Male or Female). This feature is encoded using Label Encoding.
